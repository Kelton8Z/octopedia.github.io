## Know more faster, with Octopedia

Octopedia is founded by an aspiring group of college students from CMU, UCB, U Mich, and U Pitt with the vision of automating college counselling for Chinese planning to study abroad.  To answer as many questions as possible about studying abroad, we are building a conversational search engine with our own database incorporating resources from different sites that retrieves such information for our user through an instant messaging interface.  

For the past two years, our team has attended 3 hackathons, pitched at MIT as a global finalist, joined CMUâ€™s Project Olympus Program, recruited over 20 part-time members, and interviewed over 100 potential users. Currently, we have prototypes of Android and Web App and looks forward to acquiring seed funding and reaching more people.
